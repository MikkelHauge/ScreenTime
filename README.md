# ScreenTime
Small project designed to try stuff, and at the same time, manage my sons screen time.
Still an unorganized mess, and the timer section, widget and dynamic island is still not done yet - at all.

But its basically this:

my kid can earn screen time by doing various activities incl reading or writing.

We then add the screen time in this app, and as he uses it, it reaches zero and he can reearn.

Here's a picture showing the add time tab.

bonus time is the same as regular time but its just earned in unconventional ways.

Same with spend time.
Log free time just provides a log entry for spend screen time, but it doesnt take screen time from the "banked" amount.

and finally the log:
